## üí° Interview Preparation

### Technical Interview Topics

**Solidity Fundamentals:**
```solidity
// Be prepared to explain concepts like:

// 1. Storage vs Memory vs Calldata
function example(uint[] memory data) public {
    uint[] storage storageArray = myArray;
    uint[] calldata calldataArray = data;
}

// 2. Gas optimization techniques
function optimized() external {
    uint256 localVar = storageVar; // Cache storage reads
    
    unchecked {
        localVar++; // Skip overflow checks when safe
    }
    
    storageVar = localVar;
}

// 3. Security patterns
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not owner");
    _;
}

function withdraw() external onlyOwner {
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
}
```

**Common Interview Questions:**

1. **What is the difference between transfer, send, and call?**
```solidity
// transfer: 2300 gas limit, throws on failure
payable(recipient).transfer(amount);

// send: 2300 gas limit, returns bool
bool success = payable(recipient).send(amount);

// call: No gas limit, returns bool and data
(bool success, ) = payable(recipient).call{value: amount}("");
```

2. **Explain the proxy pattern:**
```solidity
// Proxy contract delegates calls to implementation
contract Proxy {
    address public implementation;
    
    fallback() external payable {
        address impl = implementation;
        assembly {
            calldatacopy(0, 0, calldatasize())
            let result := delegatecall(gas(), impl, 0, calldatasize(), 0, 0)
            returndatacopy(0, 0, returndatasize())
            
            switch result
            case 0 { revert(0, returndatasize()) }
            default { return(0, returndatasize()) }
        }
    }
}
```

3. **How would you prevent reentrancy attacks?**
```solidity
// Using OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract SecureContract is ReentrancyGuard {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    
    function withdraw() external nonReentrant {
        uint256 balance = balances[msg.sender];
        require(balance > 0, "No balance");
        
        balances[msg.sender] = 0; // State change before external call
        
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: balance}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }
}
```

### System Design Questions

**Question: Design a DeFi lending protocol**
